**Status**: ✅ Successfully Completed  
**Testing**: ✅ All Systems Operational

---

## 📊 Summary

Your URLY project has been successfully reorganized into a clean, professional folder structure. **No code functionality was changed** - only files were moved and paths were updated.

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Created New Folder Structure
```
✅ /config              - Configuration files
✅ /database            - Database code and operations
  ├── /schemas         - Database schemas
  └── /scripts         - Database utilities
✅ /docs               - All documentation
  ├── /api            - API documentation
  ├── /configuration  - Configuration guides
  ├── /database       - Database docs
  ├── /testing        - Test reports
  ├── /system-analysis - System analysis & reports
  └── /wireframes     - Design files
✅ /scanner            - Scanner server files
✅ /tests              - All test files
✅ /utilities          - Utility scripts
```

### 2. Moved Files to Appropriate Locations

#### Configuration Files → `/config/`
- scanner.config.json
- db-config.js
- supabase-config.js

#### Database Files → `/database/`
- db-manager.js
- db-routes.js
- Schemas → `/database/schemas/`
- Scripts → `/database/scripts/`

#### Documentation → `/docs/`
- 40+ documentation files organized by category
- API, Configuration, Database, Testing, System Analysis
- Wireframes and design files

#### Scanner Files → `/scanner/`
- scan-server.js (main server)
- Detection and SSL utilities

#### Test Files → `/tests/`
- All test scripts and test data files

#### Utilities → `/utilities/`
- PDF generation scripts

## 🔧 Code Changes

Only **3 files** had minimal path updates:

### 1. `package.json`
```json
// BEFORE
"scan": "node ./scan-server.js"

// AFTER
"scan": "node ./scanner/scan-server.js"
```

### 2. `scanner/scan-server.js`
```javascript
// BEFORE
import dbManager from "./db-manager.js";
import * as dbRoutes from "./db-routes.js";

// AFTER
import dbManager from "../database/db-manager.js";
import * as dbRoutes from "../database/db-routes.js";

// Config path also updated
const configFile = path.join(__dirname, "..", "config", "scanner.config.json");
```

### 3. `database/db-manager.js`
```javascript
// BEFORE
import { supabase } from './supabase-config.js';

// AFTER
import { supabase } from '../config/supabase-config.js';
```

**That's it! Only path updates - no logic changes!**
